# UFT16 to UTF 8 Converter

This is designed to cope with basic convertion between utf-16 and utf-8, and it should be suitable for charactor sets "Basic Latin" and "Latin1", however this will not cope with latin extented.


it is also worth noting the only control set character which is passed to the system is \n, all other non printable characters are ignored.
